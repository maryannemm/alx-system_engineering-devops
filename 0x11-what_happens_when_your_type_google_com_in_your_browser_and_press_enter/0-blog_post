Certainly! Let's illustrate the flow of a request when you type **[https://www.google.com](https://www.google.com)** in your browser and press Enter. I'll break it down step by step:

1. **DNS Resolution**:
   - Your browser sends a request to the **DNS (Domain Name System) resolver** to translate the domain name "www.google.com" into an **IP address**.
   - The DNS resolver responds with the IP address of the Google server Â².

2. **Request Hits Server IP on the Appropriate Port**:
   - Using the resolved IP address, your browser establishes a connection to the Google server by sending an HTTP request over **port 80** (HTTP) or **port 443** (HTTPS).

3. **Traffic Encryption**:
   - If you're using HTTPS (which is the case for Google), the traffic is **encrypted** using SSL/TLS protocols. This ensures secure communication between your browser and the server.

4. **Firewall**:
   - The request passes through any **firewalls** or security measures set up by the network infrastructure. Firewalls may filter or allow traffic based on rules.

5. **Load Balancer**:
   - Google's infrastructure often employs **load balancers** to distribute incoming requests across multiple servers.
   - The load balancer ensures even distribution of traffic, improves performance, and provides redundancy.

6. **Web Server Answers the Request**:
   - The load balancer forwards the request to an appropriate **web server** within Google's data centers.
   - The web server processes the request and prepares to serve a web page.

7. **Application Server Generates the Web Page**:
   - If the requested page involves dynamic content (e.g., search results), the **application server** comes into play.
   - The application server generates the web page by executing code (e.g., Python, Java, PHP) and fetching data from databases.

8. **Application Server Requests Data from the Database**:
   - The application server queries the **database** (which could be distributed across multiple servers) to retrieve relevant data.
   - This data might include search results, user profiles, or any other information needed to construct the web page.

Here's a simplified diagram to visualize the flow:
